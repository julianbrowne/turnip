###Turnip

Turnip, named after the mocking term for [plump pocket watches](http://richardlangworth.com/the-turnip-churchills-breguet-pocket-watch) based on the [verge escapement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verge_escapement#Decline), is a demonstration of Lamport and Vectors clocks in action.

And of course it's an ideal excuse to make Black Adder jokes.

> Then what is so funny?  
> While preparing the turnip surprise, we had a surprise. We came across a turnip that was exactly the same shape as a thingy.  
> Oh, really?  
> It was a great big thingy.
> I found it particularly ironic my lord, because I've got a thingy shaped like a turnip.

Turnip uses javascript, [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) for animation, and [JQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery). All included.
