###Turnip

Turnip, named after the mocking term for [plump pocket watches](http://richardlangworth.com/the-turnip-churchills-breguet-pocket-watch) based on the [verge escapement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verge_escapement#Decline), is a demonstration of Lamport and Vectors clocks in action. Turnip uses javascript, [D3](https://github.com/mbostock/d3) for animation, and [JQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery).
